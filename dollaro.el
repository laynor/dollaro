;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a simple text template engine.
;; A template is a simple text containing $[variable-name] blocks.
;;
;; Literal $ symbols can be inserted normally unless they are followed by
;; an open square bracket, in which case they must be doubled.
;;
;; Example:
;; '$$[foo]' will be rendered as '$[foo]' after template substitution.
;;
;; Two functions are provided, `$:fill-template' and
;; `$:fill-template-from-file', that operate respectively on strings
;; and on files. The template variable values are passed as alists.
;;
;; To use these functions, just
;;  (require 'dollaro)
;;
;; Example Usage:
;; ($:fill-template "First Name: $[first-name], Last Name: $[last-name]"
;;                  '((first-name . "Giovanni") (last-name . "Cane")))
;;
;; ($:fill-template-from-file "/path/to/template/file" "/path/to/destination/file"
;;                            '((some-var . "some value") (another-var . "another value")))
